The context: Deep Learning for Age Related Macular Degeneration and other retina diseases
Resources: 
- model trained on subset of Kermany 2017 OCT scans dataset from scratch with squeeze net.
- notebook which includes application of the model and of the occlusion test
- which parts of the OCT are relevant for the predicted class and for the correct class - identified with a modified heatmap for cases where the prediction is wrong (the notebook includes a case of OCT scan for DME which was classified as Normal & the resulted images after application of the masks)

Requirements: Tensorflow, OpenCV, Scikit-Image, Matplotlib.
